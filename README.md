# Makersbnb

This was a group project that we worked on - the aim being to work put our team work and team building skills as a priority, and the end product being less of a priority - but a nice to have!

We were assigned teams of 4 and together, and organised our own work independently. We first decided on the MVP (to be able to post a 'space' to a page) and worked from there throughout the week to establish users, image upload, modal forms in the interface for sign up, log in and log out, grid structures on the page and we also used the Gmail gem to be able to send emails to users to let them know someone was interested in their space!

We had our highs and lows throughout the week as I'm sure all group projects do, but by the end I felt we had all learned a lot about the processes that are important to use when working in a team:
* Structured Pairing
* Using XP values to guide behaviour
* Following the full developer workflow (creating issues, branches, reviewing, merging).
* Systems such as Stand Ups, Retros, Trello Boards (Kanban) and constant check ins to make sure that everyones goals were aligned and everyone was enjoying their experience!

The questions we had to ask ourselves was: "Can you, with only a specification to guide you, work as part of a team to build a web app?" and I think we would all agree that we could.
